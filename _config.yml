  Passionate Full Stack Software Developer.

  Graduate from Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I studied MSc of Computer Science and Engineering program and specialized in Software Engineering.

  Primary field of interest is Software Engineering. 
  However, at both DTU and QUT I have taken a number of courses in Network Security and Computer Security. 
  This is an area that I have had a growing interest in the last few years.
  My Master Thesis at DTU was titled "Discovery of Rogue Mobile Phone Towers".

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
